                  <p align="justify" class="intro">Hello! I'm AniNeru and I'm an self-taught Digital Artist and Animator, currently a College student. I also draw in various artstyles. My current artist name "AniNeru" formed because of the inspiration to the Kyoto Animation nickname 'KyoAni. Since I draw Anime, I thought that the japanese translation of my nickname "Neru" and "Ani" short for 'Anime/Animation' are good together. But compared to the KyoAni nickname, I did it in vice versa which is now "AniNeru". My previous Artist names are NeruSan and Neruuu <br>&nbsp;<br>I started doing digital art way back June 2020, I was introduced into 'Pinoy Animation' where I first watched "Asheru Animation" in Facebook Watch. I got entertained by his videos and inspired me to create and learn animation. <br>&nbsp;<br> Since I was a kid, I am fascinated and amazed on Cartoons and Anime especially the cartoons and Anime in TV Channels they show, so when this opportunity came it hit my interest. I joined the Internet Art Community and many social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, (the former Twitter) X, etc. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now, I'm still learning to improve my artstyle through watching different artists that teaches fellow artists how to improve their artworks. I don't draw quite often but I really enjoyed when I randomly do it out of boredom or needs, because I exert my stocked knowledge through the span of my Hiatus. Up until today, I'm still learning things about drawing and creating my own artstyle and will be opening commissions soon! Stay tune for updates :></p>
